        Maintenance and development of the <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/mdcs">
        Material Data Curation System</a> (MDCS), a robust and customizable Django-based 
        data repository:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Enhanced MDCS exploration with RAG-like search on stored data, leveraging the 
            on-premise large language model (LLM) zoo. Provided technical leadership on LLM 
            integration.
          </li>
          <li>
            Created an automated performance framework to run JSON-based scenarios and generate 
            reports in a MongoDB database. This framework helped identify key underperforming 
            areas of the MDCS.
          </li>
          <li>
            Setup a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) infrastructure to 
            automate version control (Gerrit), testing (Jenkins), artifact storage (Nexus) and 
            application deployment (Docker and Kubernetes). This system achieved a 99% uptime 
            for the past 8 years.
          </li>
        </ul>

        Conducted sensitivity analysis for <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/trojai">TrojAI</a>, 
        using decision trees and Shapley values to measure the impact of AI modelsâ€™s 
        parameters on the detectability of trojaned behaviors. Leveraged statistical 
        modeling and visualization techniques to provide data-driven insights.
      - |
        Modularized a <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/ai-bugfinder-testbed">deep learning 
        prototype</a> to detect bugs in C code, implementing the strategy design pattern, 
        to facilitate the integration and configuration of preprocessing algorithms, 
        feature extractors and machine learning models.

    details:
      - |
        Led a team of developers in maintaining and improving multiple versions 
        of the MDCS, where XML schemas are translated into dynamic HTML forms. 
        This enabled the creation and storage of shareable XML files in MongoDB.
      - |
        Architected a <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/ocr-pipeline">Python pipeline</a> 
        to convert PDF into clean text files using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) 
        and Machine Learning. Designed the system to operate on a scalable and 
        distributed architecture using Redis for high-throughput processing.
